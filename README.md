# Forecasting Late Arrivals: Delivery Estimation
In today's competitive e-commerce landscape, ensuring timely delivery of products is crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction and loyalty. 
However, navigating the complexities of the supply chain often leads to challenges such as transportation delays and inventory management issues, resulting in late deliveries and potential revenue losses.
Our business objective is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the risk of late deliveries, allowing us to proactively mitigate risks and optimize delivery performance.
By leveraging historical transaction data and machine learning algorithms, we aim to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive financial performance, ultimately gaining a competitive edge in the market.
For this project, the team utilizes the “DataCo SMART SUPPLY CHAIN FOR BIG DATA ANALYSIS” dataset from Mendeley Data to build predictive models for latency in delivery.
The dataset consists of approximately 180519 records and includes 53 variables, that capture a variety of information like transaction details, customer information, product details, order details, and the target variable ‘Late Delivery Risk’.
